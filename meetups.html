									<b> About the speaker : </b> In recent years deep learning-based transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing. First of all, this talk will explain how transformers work. Then, we will examine some popular transformers like GPT and BERT and understand how they differ. Equipped with this understanding, we will then take a look at how we can fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment classification in Python. <br>

								By: Michael A. Alcorn</b>

								<hr>

									<img id="imgSpeaker"  src="images/speakers/Michael.jpeg">
									<br><br>
						
									<b> About the speaker : </b> Michael is currently a Ph.D. student in Anh Nguyen's deep learning lab at Auburn University in the United States. Prior to starting his Ph.D., Michael worked for several years in industry as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer at Red Hat, and he was a prizewinner in the Research Papers Competition at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. While at Auburn, he's had the opportunity to intern with both Adobe Research and the Cleveland Indians where he built deep learning models to address a range of problems. <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									Multi-agent spatiotemporal modeling, e.g., forecasting the trajectories of basketball players during a game, is a challenging task from both an algorithmic design and computational complexity perspective. Recent work has explored the efficacy of traditional deep sequential models in this domain, but these architectures are slow and cumbersome to train, particularly as model size increases. Further, prior attempts to model interactions between agents across time have limitations, such as imposing an order on the agents, or making assumptions about their relationships. In this presentation, I will introduce baller2vec, a multi-entity generalization of the standard Transformer that can, with minimal assumptions, simultaneously and efficiently integrate information across entities and time. To test the effectiveness of baller2vec for multi-agent spatiotemporal modeling, we trained it to perform two different basketball-related tasks: (1) simultaneously forecasting the trajectories of all players on the court and (2) forecasting the trajectory of the ball. Not only does baller2vec learn to perform these tasks well, it also appears to "understand" the game of basketball, encoding idiosyncratic qualities of players in its embeddings, and performing basketball-relevant functions with its attention heads. In addition to discussing some baller2vec results, I will review two fundamental deep learning concepts behind the Transformer architecture: "embeddings" and "attention".

									<b> About the speaker : </b> Thomas Wiecki is the Chief Executive Officer at PyMC Labs (www.pymc-labs.io). Prior to that Thomas was the VP of Data Science at Quantopian, where he used probabilistic programming and machine learning to help build the world’s first crowdsourced hedge fund. He is an author of the popular PyMC3 package — a probabilistic programming framework written in Python. He holds a PhD from Brown University. <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									An Intuitive Introduction to Bayesian Modeling Bayesian modeling is an extremely powerful tool in solving data science problems across different domains. And while user-friendly modeling packages like PyMC3 exist, understanding the underlying concepts still provides a challenge for many newcomers. The main reason is that usually, statistics is taught by statisticians who provide formulas with little regard for intuition. 
									
									In this talk I will take the opposite approach: throw all math out the window and explain the underlying concepts in an intuitive way.

									<b> About the speaker: </b> Sakhar Alkhereyf is a final year Computer Science doctoral student in the Natural Language Processing Lab at Columbia University, New York. His research interests include text classification incorporating social networks and Arabic NLP. Prior to his doctoral studies, he was a Research Assistant at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), where he worked on different NLP and high-performance computing (HPC) projects. <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									This talk will provide a brief overview of NLP, and mainly focus on NLP for the Arabic language. The Arabic language has its own challenges due to its nature as it exhibits a phenomenon called diglossia, where speakers use more than one variety of a language. In particular, people use different versions of Arabic in different situations: Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha) and Arabic spoken dialects. Also, will discuss some computational tools and datasets used for NLP in general and Arabic NLP.

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									utonomous Vehicles (AVs) are one of the most exciting AI applications, but it is also one of the biggest engineering challenges of our time. It is challenging because the goal is developing a vehicle than can drive safely in different geographies, weather conditions, and traffic laws. In addition, it has to decide on how to navigate when it encounters new or random situations like construction work, or a wild animal crossing the road. For this reason, developing AVs requires large amounts of data to develop numerous AI models to address different scenarios. In this talk, we will learn about the challenges, and approaches of data management and model development for AVs
