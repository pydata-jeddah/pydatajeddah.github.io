								By: Sakhar AlKhereyf</b>
								</header>

									<b> About the speaker : </b> Sakhar Alkhereyf is a final year Computer Science doctoral student in the Natural Language Processing Lab at Columbia University, New York. His research interests include text classification incorporating social networks and Arabic NLP. Prior to his doctoral studies, he was a Research Assistant at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), where he worked on different NLP and high-performance computing (HPC) projects. <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									This talk will provide a brief overview of NLP, and mainly focus on NLP for the Arabic language. The Arabic language has its own challenges due to its nature as it exhibits a phenomenon called diglossia, where speakers use more than one variety of a language. In particular, people use different versions of Arabic in different situations: Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha) and Arabic spoken dialects. Also, will discuss some computational tools and datasets used for NLP in general and Arabic NLP.

He received his Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals and his Master's degree in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Dallas. In addition to his academic interests, Fahad is also interested in data science and writing and looks forward to using both his training and experience to solve real-world challenges. <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									In this talk, I aim to explore the history of the symbiotic relationships between psychology, neuroscience, and AI. While exploring this history, I will also discuss concrete examples and case studies of how insights from neuroscience are translated into the development of AI models and how recent AI advances have influenced neuroscience and psychological research.

									<b> About the speaker : </b> Matthijs is a data science lead at Xccelerated, he received a BS degree in technics, policy and management, also a MS degree in system engineering, policy analysis and management from delft university of technology. <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									When doing time-series modelling, you often end up in a situation where you want to make long-term predictions for multiple, related, time-series. In this talk, we’ll see how we can combine the ideas behind bayesian hierarchical models and Facebook's Prophet package to do exactly that.

									<b> About the speaker : </b> Dr. Viral B. Shah is one of the creators of the Julia language and co-founder and CEO of Julia Computing. Julia combines the ease of use of Python with the speed of C. It has been downloaded over 10 million times, and is now taught at MIT, Stanford, and many universities worldwide. The Julia co-creators were recently awarded the prestigious James H. Wilkinson prize for Numerical software.  <br>

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									Julia is a modern open source programming language, originally created in 2009, and now used by over half a million users worldwide. It was designed to solve the two language problem - and provides the ease of use of Python and R with the performance of C. Today, Julia has over 4,000 community created packages, and the ability to use existing libraries written in various other languages such as Python, R, C, C++, Fortran, Java, etc.
									In this talk,we  will be introduce the Julia language, the journey, discuss the state of the data science packages in Julia, the community’s approach to differentiable programming, and how Julia is used by enterprises worldwide.

									<br>
									<b> About the talk: </b>
									utonomous Vehicles (AVs) are one of the most exciting AI applications, but it is also one of the biggest engineering challenges of our time. It is challenging because the goal is developing a vehicle than can drive safely in different geographies, weather conditions, and traffic laws. In addition, it has to decide on how to navigate when it encounters new or random situations like construction work, or a wild animal crossing the road. For this reason, developing AVs requires large amounts of data to develop numerous AI models to address different scenarios. In this talk, we will learn about the challenges, and approaches of data management and model development for AVs
