						<h3>Bayesian hierarchical time series with Prophet and PyMC3</h3>
						<p>By:Matthijs Brouns</p>
						<p>Matthijs is a data science lead at Xccelerated, he received a BS degree in technics, policy and management, also a MS degree in system engineering, policy analysis and management from delft university of technology.</p>
                        <p>About the talk:</p>
						<p>When doing time-series modelling, you often end up in a situation where you want to make long-term predictions for multiple, related, time-series. In this talk, we’ll see how we can combine the ideas behind bayesian hierarchical models and Facebook's Prophet package to do exactly that.</p>

						<h3> Julia - a fresh approach to technical computing</h3>
						<p>By: Dr.Viral B. Shah</p>
						<p>Dr. Viral B. Shah is one of the creators of the Julia language and co-founder and CEO of Julia Computing. Julia combines the ease of use of Python with the speed of C. It has been downloaded over 10 million times, and is now taught at MIT, Stanford, and many universities worldwide. The Julia co-creators were recently awarded the prestigious James H. Wilkinson prize for Numerical software. </p>
						<p>About the talk:</p>
						<p>Julia is a modern open source programming language, originally created in 2009, and now used by over half a million users worldwide. It was designed to solve the two language problem - and provides the ease of use of Python and R with the performance of C. Today, Julia has over 4,000 community created packages, and the ability to use existing libraries written in various other languages such as Python, R, C, C++, Fortran, Java, etc.
						In this talk,we  will be introduce the Julia language, the journey, discuss the state of the data science packages in Julia, the community’s approach to differentiable programming, and how Julia is used by enterprises worldwide.</p>

						<h3>Web Scraping with Python using Requests & Beautiful Soup.</h3>
						<p>By: Juan Sebastian Vasquez</p>
						<p>Juan is a Business Analyst with a digital media company focused on financial services and a Data Analytics instructor at General Assembly. He received a BS degree in Advertising with a specialization in Business from the University of Florida. Complementing his experience as a former advertiser and tech salesperson, Juan has managed to turn data into a data analyst working towards data science. He is an entrepreneur and leader who has experience with SQL, Python, business intelligence tools, GIS, digital strategy, and product development.</p>
						<p>About the talk:</p>
						<p>we will explore web scraping basics using requests and Beautiful Soup with Python. We will be using a Google Colab Notebook and will explore the web site's HTML before jumping into any code.
                        Aside from it being fun, web scraping can help you and your organization enrich existing data, grow new market research, dig for previously untapped insights, and unlock new narratives.</p>

						<h3>Data Management & Model Development for Autonomous Vehicles</h3>

						<p>By: Yhaya Khoja</p>
						<p>Yahya is an engineer, technical consultant, and now an advisor at the Saudi Ministry of Energy. He worked as a Technical Product Manager at NVIDIA and as a Data Networks Engineer at Saudi Aramco. He received his BS in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University and his joint degree in MBA and MS in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. Due to his expertise in managing complex projects, Mr. Khoja built a deeper understanding of ML and AI, establishing a solid foundation in business management, sales, and product development. He is passionate about developing products that leverage Machine Learning and AI to solve problems.</p>

						<p>About the talk:</p>
						<p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are one of the most exciting AI applications, but it is also one of the biggest engineering challenges of our time. It is challenging because the goal is developing a vehicle than can drive safely in different geographies, weather conditions, and traffic laws. In addition, it has to decide on how to navigate when it encounters new or random situations like construction work, or a wild animal crossing the road. For this reason, developing AVs requires large amounts of data to develop numerous AI models to address different scenarios. In this talk, we will learn about the challenges, and approaches of data management and model development for AVs</p>

						<h3>Custom Scikit-learn Estimators</h3>
						<p>By: Adrin Jalali</p>
						<p>Adrin is an Open Source Developer at Anaconda and a Core Developer for the Python machine learning library Scikit-learn. He has been contributing to the scikit-learn project since 2018. Before that, He was a Ph.D. student in Computational Biology at Max Planck Institute for Informatics. He worked on designing machine learning tools to classify samples collected from various biological processes.</p>

						<p>About the talk:</p>
						<p>Often the hardest part of solving a machine learning problem can be finding the right estimator for the job. In some cases, you may decide to write your customized scikit-learn estimator, that precisely tackle the ML problem at hand. In this talk, you will learn about how to design a custom scikit-learn estimator. It will walk you through the steps to develop objects that safely interact with scikit-learn Pipelines and model selection tools.</p>
